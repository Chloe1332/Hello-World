<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>
  HTML is an acronym for the phrase 'Hyper Text Markup Language'. It is used for
  web pages to define its structure. A HTML is broken into three parts: the
  start tag, the contents, and the end tag. Through this, it tells the browser
  which piece of text is a link, a paragraph, a heading, or anything else.

  I decided to take this class to learn a basic understanding of code. I wanted
  to try an online class, and this seems like a good place to start. I was also
  thinking of maybe making a freelance art website.
